# Self-Hosted WebOrbiton Dashboard

Self-Hosted WebOrbiton Dashboard is a lightweight, self-hosted status monitoring and uptime dashboard designed for PHP.

The monitoring logic and dashboard run entirely on your own server.
Some static assets (styles) may be loaded from official WebOrbiton domains.
If you prefer a fully self-hosted setup, you can copy the CSS files from the
WebOrbiton servers and host them locally on your own server.
